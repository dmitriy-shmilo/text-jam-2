As a proud owner of a half-dilapidated farm, you have an option \
of produce growing and selling. This will be one of your best sources \
of income.

Look out for fertile soil patches, which can be $Gtill$*ed and $Gwater$*ed. \
Once the soil is tilled, a seed can be $Gplant$*ed, which will begin the plant \
lifecycle. Keep your plant watered regularly, and after some time it will mature. \
Mature plants can then be $Gharvest$*ed, and the produce sold to a vendor."""

Any untilled soil patch can be tilled if you have a hoe. Seeds can be planted only in \
tilled soil. If not occupied by a plant, tilled soil will revert to its \
previous state over time.

Tilling is an exhausting task, and will take a good chunk of energy when \
performed. Tilling also requires a considerable amount of time. \
Increase your skill, use higher quality tools and keep your tools in good shape \
in order to reduce both the energy consumption and tilling time.

Like many other tools, hoes will lose durability with use, and need to be eventually \
repaired or replaced. Higher skill will reduce wear and tear."""
